I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Florida Polytechnic University. I obtained my PhD in Computer Science from the University of Kentucky and subsequently served as an ORISE Fellow at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

My research focuses on leveraging artificial intelligence to address critical challenges in healthcare and engineering. I am also leading **Multimodal Health Research Lab** to develop robust AI methodologies that integrate diverse data modalitiesâ€”including medical imaging, natural language, and clinical dataâ€”to advance precision medicine and improve patient outcomes.

Through interdisciplinary collaboration, our goal is to translate theoretical AI advances into practical healthcare solutions with meaningful societal impact.

## Research Area
- Multimodal Data Fusion
- Generative AI (Vision & NLP)
- AI in Health
- Disaster Informatics
