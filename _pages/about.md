I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Florida Polytechnic University. I obtained my PhD in Computer Science from the University of Kentucky and subsequently served as an ORISE Fellow at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

My research focuses on leveraging artificial intelligence to address critical challenges in healthcare and engineering. The Multimodal Health Research Lab aims to develop robust AI methodologies that integrate diverse data modalities—including medical imaging, natural language, and clinical data—to advance precision medicine and improve patient outcomes.

Through interdisciplinary collaboration, our goal is to translate theoretical AI advances into practical healthcare solutions with meaningful societal impact.
